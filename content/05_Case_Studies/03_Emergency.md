**This case study reveals a fictional emergency event unfolding in London and how a platform like Yip might be used**

1. Explosion heard at 17:00 on Northern Line platform in Leicester Square underground station.
2. People are running from the platform and up the escalators
3. A small amount of individuals manage to snap pics of the unfolding event from within
4. People start emerging on the streets
5. Calls have been made to the emergency services
6. In the chaos the only information the emergency responders have is the possibility of an explosive device

Individuals emerging on the street start taking pictures and recording the crowds and noises.

Within 5 minutes there are dozens of reports surfacing, some with single photos, others with continuous streams of photos and other media from people that have chosen to stay at the scene.

Within 15 minutes, there is some kind of coherence emerging from the reports -- they are tied together, semantically, via their tags, content and similarity ratings. 

An overview of the event (a conglomeration) is starting to come through -- with 'Breaking News' articles from the likes of the BBC and the Guardian starting to emerge, they themselves sourcing some information and media from the vast array of reports.

Eventually, the event dies down, after the emergency services discover the presence of no explosive device. The station remains shut for investigation.

The reports now serve archival purposes for the citizenry and whatever authorities are investigating the event, and the way it unfolded.
