A tech-conference, for example, needs to be able to manage the movements and actions of a vast number of audience members. Doing so via a pre-assembled schedule is sometimes insufficient. It would be nice to be able to communicate a change of plan or an important cancellation or addition to the schedule via a centralised stream. Furthermore, emergent events, such as guest appearances or after-parties, would very much benefit from a collaborative stream where participants could share their insight and media.

One can imagine a private or public instance of Yip presenting "TechConf 2013" as the central umbrella event, and there being a number of integral events within, such as:

 * Talk #1: Bob Smith talks about tech
 * Question time
 * Break in the interval room
 * Lunchtime @ SomeRestaurant, Some Street, ...
 * Talk #2: Sarah Brown talks about tech
 * etc.

Attendees would be able to add reactions and media to any of these items, or just within the umbrella event itself.
