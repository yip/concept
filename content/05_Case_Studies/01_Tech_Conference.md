A tech-conference would benefit from having a handle on the movements and actions of a vast number of audience members. Doing so via a pre-assembled schedule is sometimes insufficient. It would be nice to be able to communicate a change of plan, an important cancellation or addition to the schedule via a centralised stream -- i.e. a single place where attendees can check for updates. Furthermore, emergent events, such as guest appearances or after-parties, would very much benefit from a collaborative stream where participants could share their insight and media under one umbrella.

One can imagine a private or public instance of Yip presenting "TechConf 2013" as a core event. Event attendees would be able to report on a variety of events occurring within the conference, e.g.

 * Talk #1: Bob Smith talks about tech
 * Question time
 * Break in the interval room
 * Lunchtime @ SomeRestaurant, Some Street, ...
 * Talk #2: Sarah Brown talks about tech
 * etc.

Their reports would contain reactions from the talks, recordings, photos, and any web material they'd like to pull in (e.g. PDF slides).

Twitter and other platforms do serve the needs for certain types of updates, but there is no service that consolidates everything together.
