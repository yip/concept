A tech-conference, for example, needs to be able to manage the movements and actions of a vast number of audience members. Doing so via a pre-assembled schedule is sometimes insufficient. It would be nice to be able to communicate a change of plan or an important cancellation or addition to the schedule via a centralised stream. Furthermore, emergent events, such as guest appearances or after-parties, would very much benefit from a collaborative stream where participants could share their insight and media.

One can imagine a private or public instance of Yip presenting "TechConf 2013" as a core event. Event attendees would be able to report on a variety of events occurring within the conference, e.g.

 * Talk #1: Bob Smith talks about tech
 * Question time
 * Break in the interval room
 * Lunchtime @ SomeRestaurant, Some Street, ...
 * Talk #2: Sarah Brown talks about tech
 * etc.

Their reports would contain reactions from the talks, recordings, photos, and any web material they'd like to pull in (e.g. PDF slides).
