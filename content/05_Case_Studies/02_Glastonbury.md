> The [Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival) is a performing arts festival that takes place near Pilton, Somerset, England, best known for its contemporary music, but also for dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other arts.

The festival lasts for three or four days. Paying festival goers, amounting to nearly 175,000 in 2013, stay in tents, caravans and motorhomes and, throughout the four days, will attend not only the primary musical lineup but also many of the smaller events occuring, such as theatrical performances, circus acts and other musical performances.

An event-goer will want to absorb as much of the event as possible, and will probably have a few events and lineups earmarked for viewing. 

The logistical managers and volunteers that run the event have a massive project both in ferrying people to and from the campsite, and within, in additon to managing accommodation, regular flow of events, uninterrupted lineups, quick accident recovery etc.

There is no doubt that such an event would benefit from Yip in the following ways:

  * Timings of events
  * Emergent incident reporting
  * Weather-related news
  * Photos / Videos
  * Reactions / Comments / Tweets

There would be an umbrella "Glastonbury 2013" stream, publicly collaborated, containing integral event streams within: E.g. Arcadia would be a integral (sub) event within "Glastonbury 2013".

Organisers and volunteers will gain credibility, so that their contributions to the stream are automatically verified and promoted, via a number of methods:

 * Prior proof of credibility (before event)
 * Through previous actions via Yip, proving their reliability
 * Vicarious approval
