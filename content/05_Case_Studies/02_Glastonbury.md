**ACTIVE DISCUSSION: [How to gauge importance/gravitas?](https://github.com/yip/concept/issues/1)**

> The [Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glastonbury_Festival) takes place near Pilton, Somerset, England. It is best known for its contemporary music, but also for dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and other arts.

The festival lasts for three or four days. Paying festival goers, amounting to nearly 175,000 in 2013, stay in tents, caravans and motor-homes and, throughout the four days, will attend not only the primary musical lineup but also many of the smaller events occurring, such as theatrical performances, circus acts and secondary musical performances.

The logistical managers and volunteers that run the event have a massive project both in ferrying people to and from the campsite, and within, in additon to managing accommodation, regular flow of events, uninterrupted lineups, quick accident recovery etc.

There is no doubt that such an event would benefit from Yip in the following ways:

  * Timings of events
  * Emergent incident reporting
  * Weather-related news
  * Photos / Videos
  * Reactions / Comments / Tweets

There could be an official report being streamed from the organizers themselves -- this could contain any information that the goers would benefit from.

Individual event-goers would also curate reports, gathering real-time media through their experiences. 

Dozens of reports -- dozens of perspectives -- could be drawn together to create a real-time mashup experience where you can see the varied experiences of GLastonbury happening in realtime from any where in the world.

It would have massive archival value too, both for the event organisers (future marketing material), and for the event-goers (memories), not to mention the journalistic value for all the people not able to attend.
