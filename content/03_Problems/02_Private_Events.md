Examples of private events include:

 * A Birthday party
 * A Family gathering
 * A Tech Conference
 * A Corporate Event
 * A School FÃªte

There are currently no mediums for the people attending such an event to collaborate on the happenings within the event, assembling in real-time a timeline & map including images, videos and other media.

The *photo album* is one example of an old-school solution, except its value is only archival. And usually, it only consists of images from a single member of the event, yet there are no-doubt many pieces of media and much insight that goes underutilised.

A medium that brings together all perspectives of the event from all participants is hugely lacking. It would be useful as a real-time discovery tool, a planning tool, and a tool for creating a photo-album-like archive of the event shown through various media.

### Real-time monitoring

Privately run events can be very large and can happen over a number of days. For example a design or technology exhibition. As such there are bound to be smaller occurrences (*sub events*) that are note-worthy within the scope of the main event itself.
