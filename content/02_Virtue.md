> "Make discoverable the pulse of the world, in your pocket."

The purpose of Yip is to:

 * Provide people with a means to discover what matters
 * Enable crowd-sourced and transparent journalism
 * Reinvent streaming for private and public events

---

Yip is an open-source effort to bring about a new way of reporting and discovering events in real-time.

We see the world lacking in a medium to convey and discover events. Events of all types, from entertainment and birthday parties to news-streams and disaster timelines.

Human lives are composed of events, large and small, and our effectiveness at recording and discovering these has been hugely lacking. An event is not just a Facebook Album, a Twitter stream, or a blog post. An event is a real-time slice of our lives bounded by a topical consistency and measured by its significance and positiveness. As such, people would greatly benefit from a free, open-source and all-encompassing medium for the reporting and archiving these events.

### But why "open source" it?

So that we can:

 * Garner a truly passionate collective of contributors
 * Get key scrutiny of our privacy/security software practices
 * Provide the world with an infinitely useful piece of software with no commercial interests
 
The concept is being developed in the open so that the it can benefit from being truly optimised and near-perfected before the software is released. There is no benefit in starting early down the wrong road; we'd rather pick the right road and take it slowly, keeping in mind our endeavour to create a platform that is:

 * Reliable to run; with minimised downtime & bugs
 * Safe from vulnerabilities and privacy concerns
 * Perfected in its User Experience; giving users what they want
 * In-line with our principles and virtues

### Semantic Web

Yip is dedicated to uphold the ideals and tenets of the [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). The challenges of the Semantic Web are as follows, along with how Yip intends to deal with them within its own scope:

 * Vastness: Speedy servers, taking advantage of CDNs, optimised I/O code
 * Vagueness: Yip endeavours to retain semantics in its data input UX
 * Uncertainty: The wiki-like nature evolves towards truth
 * Inconsistency: These are unavoidable but will be moderated and presented
 * Deceit: Gamified self-regulation

Yip seeks to provide a central ontology for event-related information in the real world (See [Glossary: Event](/Glossary/Event)).
