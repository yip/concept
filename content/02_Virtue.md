> "Make discoverable the pulse of the world"

The purpose of Yip is to:

 * Provide people with a means to discover what matters
 * Enable crowd-sourced and transparent journalism
 * Reinvent streaming for private and public events

---

Yip is an open-source endeavour with the goal of bringing about a new way of reporting and discovering events in real-time.

We see the world lacking in a medium to convey and discover events. Events of all types, from entertainment and birthday parties to news-streams and disaster timelines.

Human lives are composed of events, large and small, and our effectiveness at recording and discovering these has been hugely lacking. An event is not just a Facebook Album, a Twitter stream, or a blog post. An event is a real-time slice of our lives bounded by a topical consistency and measured by its significance and positiveness. As such, people would greatly benefit from a free, open-source and all-encompassing medium for the reporting and archiving of these events.

### But why "open source" it?

So that we can:

 * Garner a truly passionate collective of contributors
 * Get key scrutiny of our privacy/security software practices
 * Provide the world with an infinitely useful piece of software with no commercial interests
 
The concept is being developed in the open so that the it can benefit from being truly optimised and near-perfected before the software is released. There is no benefit in starting early down the wrong road; we'd rather pick the right road and take it slowly, keeping in mind our endeavour to create a platform that is:

 * Reliable to run; with minimised downtime & bugs
 * Safe from vulnerabilities and privacy concerns
 * Perfected in its User Experience; giving users what they want
 * In-line with our principles and virtues

### Why not make it a commercial endeavour?

We see that not everything that is good, wholesome or otherwise beneficial for humanity is commercially viable. We don't want to constrain this effort by imposing financial objectives on it.

A commercial project of a similar genre would likely have to focus on a specific niche of events and a particular demographic, and it would have to gear the interface towards monetization, whether in the form of advetisement, tiered access or sponsored events. Yip is concerned with all genres and all use-cases and doesn't want to limit its users in any way.

Eventually there may be an opportunity to create healthy commercial partnerships but initially the endeavour is very much focused on being open, transparent and fundamentally non-commercial.

### Semantic Web

Yip is dedicated to uphold the ideals and tenets of the [Semantic Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web). The challenges of the Semantic Web are as follows, along with how Yip intends to deal with them within its own scope:

 * Vastness: Speedy servers, taking advantage of CDNs, optimised I/O code
 * Vagueness: Yip endeavours to retain semantics in its data input UX
 * Uncertainty: The wiki-like nature evolves towards truth and assured credibility
 * Inconsistency: Is is unavoidable but will be moderated and presented transparently
 * Deceit: Gamified self-regulation should help tackle this

Yip seeks to provide a central [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) for event-related information in the real world (See [Glossary: Event](/Glossary/Event)).
