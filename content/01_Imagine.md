## Personal

> Imagine a platform that allows you to centralise all the experiences of a personal occasion -- a birthday, a party, a life event -- in photos, videos, tweets, and more ... all while owning every piece of content you add and resting assured that your private content is secured. Imagine if you could do this without any of that information even touching the Internet. Imagine a platform that'd play back your special occasions, presenting them to you as media-rich timelines, littered with photos from you and your friends.

## Public

> Imagine a platform where you can discover and monitor events spanning the entire spectrum of human interest. Imagine having at your finger tips the power to know what's happening, here, within a mile, within your town, within your country. Anything of public significance. A president elected. A fire causing traffic hold-ups. A food market around the corner. A war. Anything that touches, in both good or bad ways, the lives of those surrounding you.

## News

> Imagine a platform that revolutionises online news media. Imagine tracking a news story, seeing information flowing in live from around the globe, media from people on the ground, facts and statistics as they emerge from history being made. Imagine reporters, fact-checkers and laymen alike collaborating side-by-side on the topics that are important to them.

## Abroad

> Imagine landing in a new place. A city far from home where nobody speaks your language. You want to know where to go and what to experience. The guide books are okay but they don't tell you what's happening *now*, what events are emerging around you as you stand there bewildered. 

## Future

> Imagine being able to zoom in to any location on a map and being given live access to the pulse of that place. Imagine every notable event in the public space logged and portrayed. A volleyball tournament concludes. A man busks with his bassoon to a crowd of onlookers. A cupcake contest commences. A storm brews. A bus leaves. The coast guard saves a boy. You're able to live within the pitter-patter around you, weaving around inconvenient incidents and meandering between previously unknown joys. The real world is yours to enjoy.

### Example of *Air* (a public yip instance):

> Imagine getting a snapshot of what's happening in your city, right now:
