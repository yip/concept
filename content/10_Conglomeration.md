Within Yip Conglomeration is the process of drawing various reports of a single event together.

Reports are gauged against each-other on account of their similarity in the following areas:

 * Topic (established via NLP and tagging)
 * Proximity in location
 * Proximity in time
 * Manually specified relationships

To gain an overview of a specific event Yip gathers relevant reports and outputs an encapsulating Overview which draws on content from all of the reports.

So, given *Event Zulu*, users *Bob* and *Sue* create separate Reports detailing *Zulu* from their individual perspectives. Yip sees the topical similarity between the two Reports and conglomerates them into an Overview. The Reports are still singular but their real-world relationship (i.e. both reporting the same event) is now formalised within the platform, meaning that another user can discover *Event Zulu* from both *Bob* and *Sue*'s perspective within a single Overview.
