An **Emergent Event** is an **[Event](/Glossary/Event)** that is in the process of coming into being or becoming prominent *(syn. nascent)*.

Specifically, within the scope of Yip, it is an event that is considered unplanned, unexpected or previously unknown by the vast public.

This can include:

 * A traffic collision
 * An impromptu street performance
 * A train-line closure
 * A celebrity appearing at a premiere
 * A protest outside an embassy

While some of these events were planned, they were only known and expected by a select few. They are considered Emergent because the vast public were not aware of they would happen, and through their coming-to-being the public begin to gain interest and thus the event starts to gain significance and prominence.

Eventually such events stop being Emergent and merely become Current, and eventually Historical.
