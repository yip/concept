Yip seeks to define an [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) for Real-World Events.

> In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation". An ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be used to model a domain, that is, the type of objects and/or concepts that exist, and their properties and relations. *(Source: [Ontology (information science)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)))*
