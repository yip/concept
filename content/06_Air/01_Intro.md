"*Air*" (*codename*) is a single instance of the eventual Yip platform. Is it an extension of all that has been said so far relating to Yip's concept -- but it is especially geared towards the reporting and discovery of events in the public eye.

Eventually, one imagines a person visiting:

 > yip.io/london/NW3

... to find out what's happening in NW3 at that very time.

And that person would perhaps also log on to *yip.io* or the eventual Yip mobile app to add or contribute to a current event; something local and niche like a "unplanned band playing in the park" or something more global such as "russian president visits Brighton".
