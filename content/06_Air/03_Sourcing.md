One of the greatest challenges this project faces is how we amass, on a continual basis, a stream of real-time events.

### Automatic Sourcing

By crawling websites, utilising public APIs and creating partnerships with event owners/organisers we can continually source a wide selecton of scheduled events via automatic means.

Our options, in more detail, include:

 * Crawl venue websites for future events (e.g. museums, galleries, clubs)
 * Use public APIs to gain data on ticketed events (e.g. EventBrite)
 * Use public APIs to gain data on traffic closures/disruptions (e.g. TfL's Live Traffic Disruptions API)
 * Privately agreed APIs with partners (*TODO: Determine partners!*)

### Manual Sourcing

The only way for us to stay up to date and healthily sourced, especially with **[Emergent Events](/Glossary/Emergent_Event)**, is to have people on the ground using our app, continually telling us what's going on in the world around them.

This is the challenge: *how do we motivate a person to use our app to report an event that they happen upon?* THis is discussed in "**[Appeal](Appeal)**".
