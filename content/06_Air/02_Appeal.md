To gain any sort of traction Air will have to appeal to a mass demographic as both a medium for reporting *and* discovering.

The discovery side is almost inherently appealing:

 * Ability to discover events to attend (concerts, sales, flash mobs)
 * Ability to discover things to avoid (closures, collisions, disasters etc.)
 * Ability to monitor events as they unfold

The overall success of the platform, however, relies on us having enough reports (that are accurate and varied) for people to discover events via.
