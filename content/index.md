These documents outline the central concept of Yip, a concept and piece of software that seeks to:

 * Provide people with a means to discover what matters
 * Enable transparent participatory journalism
 * Reinvent streaming for private and public event reporting

We're really interested in and concerned with:

 * Free & Open Source Software
 * Personal Privacy & Public Transparency
 * Democratic & Participatory Journalism
 * "Gamified" Reporting & Discovery
 * Collaborative Self-Regulation
