Yip seeks to define an *(initially informal)* [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) for Real-World Events.

> In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation". An ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be used to model a domain, that is, the type of objects and/or concepts that exist, and their properties and relations. *(Source: [Ontology (information science)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)))*

## Event

An **Event**, as far as Yip is concerned, is a temporal occurrence that takes place in a static or varying real-world location.

Anything that fulfils the following criteria can be considered an Event:

 * Is planned to occur, is currently occurring or has occurred.
 * Relating to a single topic, activity or genre
 * Manifests in the real physical universe at a single or series of static locations.
 * Cannot be said to be a physical object.
 * Cannot be said to only exist in a computer or on a network.

Examples of Events, from broad to minute:

 * Human Existence
 * Industrial Revolution
 * First World War
 * Invention of LED
 * September 11 Attacks
 * Barack Obama's election
 * Traffic collision, M25
 * Central Line underground closure
 * ...
 * News conference, Syrian Embassy
 * Notting Hill Festival
 * ...
 * Sale @ Topshop, Oxford Circus
 * ...
 * Your Birthday
 * ...
 * Sam goes kayaking
 * ...
 * George finds lost slipper
 * ...

### State: Future

An event that has yet to begin.

### State: Emergent

An event that is emerging; coming into being or becoming prominent *(syn. nascent)*.

It is an Event that is first added to Yip when it is in the process of emerging. Usually these are unplanned, unexpected or previously unknown by the vast public.

An example would be a traffic collision.

### State: Current

An event that is currently occurring.

### State: Historical

An event that has occurred in the past (*that is completed*).

## Relationships

### Topical

*(The only bidirectional Event Relationship)*

A topical relationship exists when **Event A** is related to **Event B** by virtue of them both sharing a topic, genre or subject. For example, the events *"Royal Baby Born"* and *"Queen visits youth centre"* are topically related because they both concern the Royal Family.

### Causal

A causal relationship exists when **Event B** could not have happened if **Event A** hadn't occurred. It does not represent a sole cause.

For example, *"Snowden granted asylum in Russia"* could not have happened if *"Snowden arrives in Russia"* hadn't happened first -- so there is said to be a causal relationship here.

### Integral

An integral relationship exists when **Event B** exists *within* **Event A**.

For example, *"Second World Trade Centre Tower Collapses"* exists within the event of *"September 11 Attacks"*.
