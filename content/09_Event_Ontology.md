Yip seeks to define an *(initially informal)* [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)) for Real-World Events.

> In theory, an ontology is a "formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualisation". An ontology provides a shared vocabulary, which can be used to model a domain, that is, the type of objects and/or concepts that exist, and their properties and relations. *(Source: [Ontology (information science)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)))*

## Event

An **Event**, as far as Yip is concerned, is a temporal occurrence that takes place in a static or varying real-world location.

Anything that fulfils the following criteria can be considered an Event:

 * Is planned to occur, is currently occurring or has occurred.
 * Relating to a single topic, activity or genre
 * Manifests in the real physical universe at a single or series of static locations.
 * Cannot be said to be a physical object.
 * Cannot be said to only exist in a computer or on a network.

Examples of Events, from broad to minute:

 * Human Existence
 * Industrial Revolution
 * First World War
 * Invention of LED
 * September 11 Attacks
 * Barack Obama's election
 * Traffic collision, M25
 * Central Line underground closure
 * ...
 * News conference, Syrian Embassy
 * Notting Hill Festival
 * ...
 * Sale @ Topshop, Oxford Circus
 * ...
 * Your Birthday
 * ...
 * Sam goes kayaking
 * ...
 * George finds lost slipper
 * ...

### State: Emergent

An **Emergent State** is applied to an Event that is in the process of coming into being or becoming prominent *(syn. nascent)*.

It is an Event that is first added to Yip when it is in the process of emerging. Usually these are unplanned, unexpected or previously unknown by the vast public.

This can include:

 * A traffic collision
 * An impromptu street performance
 * A train-line closure
 * A celebrity appearing at a premiere
 * A protest outside an embassy

While some of these events were planned, they were only known and expected by a select few. They are considered Emergent because the vast public were not aware of they would happen, and through their coming-to-being the public begin to gain interest and thus the event starts to gain significance and prominence.

Eventually such events stop being Emergent and merely become Current, and eventually Historical.

### State: Current
